/**
 * File: writeXLSX.java
 * Description: This program writes to a excel file (.xlsx). It requires a filepath (taken as a string) for its
 *              constructor. This program also requires APACHE POI dependencies download link provided below:
 *              https://poi.apache.org/download.html
 * IMPORTANT!   File: poi-bin-4.1.2-20200217.zip (binaries)
 *
 *              * User will need to configure project structure to include APACHE POI dependancies during compile time
 *              by adding all .jar files from the zipped folder.
